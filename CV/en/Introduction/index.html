        <p>
            My career started in 2010. I obtained the position of 
            a lawyer in a small company. I have been growing as a 
            professional since that time. I changed a few companies 
            until I stopped in state-owned enterprise, where I passed 
            my way from a regular lawyer to the Head of the Legal Department.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As for me, if a lawyer wants to be good at the work he does, 
            he needs to understand the whole scope of processes in the 
            company, he works in.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my practice I strive exploring and understanding company's 
            business strategies and processes, company's structure and 
            core values. I make my legal decisions based on this research, 
            so I can be confident that I am acting in the best interest of 
            the company and my decisions can benefit company's strategies 
            and corporate reputation.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have knowledge and skills for successful analyzing of 
            business-algorithms and efficient communicating with different 
            departments of business, starting with production up to executive 
            management. With successful analysis of organization's structure 
            and business processes I`m able to decrease legal risks and 
            provide legal security in all stages of management decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are a lot of successful projects in my portfolio, 
            realized in the companies with a difficult structure of 
            management. Systems of paperwork, personnel accounting, 
            anti-corruption control, compliance control, privacy 
            policies etc. were developed and implemented by me in 
            different stages of my professional career.
        </p>

        <p>
            For now, I`m an executive professional in the legal 
            area with a set of hard and soft skills, competent 
            in solving all types of legal issues.
        </p>

        <p>
            My goal is to find a job in IT sphere, with ability 
            to work with a strong and ambitious team of professionals who 
            love and respect their work.
        </p>
